# Weather Or Not

is a Backbone app that uses the HTML5 Geolocation API to pull the current weather from The Dark Sky Forecast API and display it on the screen.

NOTE: It may not work with your current browswer (ie. Chrome) due to denied location access that cannot easily be changed at least in Chrome. Try using Safari and allow access to your location.
